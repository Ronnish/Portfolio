<h3>The Solomon Islands is a fascinating archipelago. Not only are the local traditions and customs still very much practiced
on a daily basis, but modern European influences are also found. The country is more renowned for its recent upheavals,
which have been stopped for the time being.</h3>

&nbsp;


<Article>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the time the first Europeans began visiting the Solomon Islands, the country was nothing more than separate Pacific
islands notorious for cannibalism and headhunting. Spanish explorers were the first to visit the archipelago in the
16th century. It wasn’t until 1893 that Britain declared the Solomon Islands as a protectorate. This was implemented
to stop the ‘blackbirding’ trade, which saw many native islanders taken as slaves to the agricultural plantations of
Fiji and Australia.</p>

<p>Over the next 10 years, more islands became part of the Solomon Islands British protectorate. By 1900, the areas formerly
administered by Germany were handed over to the British. Missionaries, whose attempts to spread Christianity prior to
1893 led to revolts by locals, began to successfully convert the native population to Christianity. Large scale plantation
firms also settled in the Solomon Islands at the beginning of the 20th century. Coconut plantations became the main
source of income for locals.</p>

<p>WWII saw the stoppage of most plantations across the Solomon Islands. Expatriate workers were forced to evacuate to Australia
or New Zealand. Fierce battles, such as the Battle of Guadalcanal, raged on between 1942 and 1945. Many thousands of
soldiers and native civilians lost their lives during the Solomon Islands campaign. Visiting the Guadalcanal American
War Memorial is a must.</p>

<p>Following the war, the Solomon Islands enjoyed a more stable administration, resulting in the increase in governmental
independence. However, it wasn’t until 1976 that Britain granted the Solomon Islands full independence. This was greatly
influenced by the independence of Papua New Guinea from Australia the year before.</p>

<p>However, since independence, the Solomon Islands have experienced anything but smooth sailing. Ethnic tensions led to
civil unrest in the late 1990s and this is still simmering today. Large scale rioting rocked the capital, Honiara, in
2006, but eventually the violence was quelled thanks to intervention from the United Nations, led by Australian, New
Zealand, and Fijian forces. In 2007, a horrific tsunami and earthquake hit the archipelago, resulting in more than 50
deaths and millions of dollars in damage. Visit the National Museum of Solomon Islands (Mendana Avenue, Honiara) for
further information about the country’s history.</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Due to European influences throughout the Solomon Islands’ history, Christianity is the predominant faith in the country.
More than 95 percent of the population follows some sort of Christianity, including South Seas Evangelists, and Catholics.
Traditional culture is still prevalent throughout the country, but traditional lifestyles exist side-by-side with European
influences.
</p>
<p>In the rural areas of the country, tribal customs are the most important social norms. Traditional bartering systems
are still used between many of the village areas. Even the village life is relatively similar to that of the time of
pre-European arrival. Items are made from local leaves and grasses, and traditional music is still heard. In addition,
the ancient form of the Solomon Islands dance can also be found.</p>

<h2>Languages of The Solomon Islands</h2>

<p>There are 76 individual languages recorded in the Solomon Islands, of which 73 of these languages are still in use, and 3 are extinct. 
  Sixteen of these languages are either in trouble or slowly diminishing.
</p>


<p>About 70 languages are spoken in the greater Solomon Islands archipelago. This is a much bigger region as compared to the Solomon Island itself. 
  The official language is English while the common language (lingua franca) is Pidgin. English is used in the local media, in government transactions, 
  and in some businesses. Despite English being the official language, it is only spoken by about 2% of the population. 
  Its lack of popularity also means it has not been embraced as the language of instruction in schools.</p>

<p>The Islanders have developed a Pidgin that is specific to the Solomon Island, a language that was derived from English. 
  This English Creole is the lingua franca meaning that most of the population uses the language as a way of communication.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>The Most Popular Languages</h2>
<p>The bigger population of the people are ethnically Melanesian, making the speakers of the language account for about 85% of the population. 
  Polynesian speakers form a small minority of the population at about 4%. 
  They are mainly found in the southern part of Rennell and Bellona, and the Stewart Islands (Sikaiana), Tikopia, and Anuta.
</p>
<p>The Micronesian language of Papua is common among immigrants of Gilbertese and Turaluans. 
  The speakers of the Papuan language attribute for 9% of the population.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Minority Languages</h2>
<p>There are other languages spoken in the country, a few with a notable number of speakers will be highlighted.</p>
<p>Cheke Holo is a language spoken by around 10,840 speakers. The speakers are mainly found in Santa Isabel Island, Kia District, and Hograno coastal villages. 
  The language belongs to the Western Oceanic language group.</p>
<p>Are’are is spoken by 17,800 people who are found in the Malaita Region. The language belongs to the Southeast Solomonic family group.</p>
<p>The Gela language is spoken by about 11,876 people in the region of Florida Island. 
  The language is spoken in three dialects which are very similar that only differ on very few phonological facts.</p>
<p>Ghari is a language of the oceanic family that is widely spoken on the Guadalcanal Island. It is spoken by about 12,119 people. 
  Its Vaturanga dialect was used extensively in missionary translations.</p>
<p>The other spoken languages include Kwaio which is spoken by 13,249 people in Central Malaita; Lau, spoken by 16,937 people in Malaita; Lengo, spoken by 13,800 people in Guadalcanal Island; and Toabaita, spoken by 12,600 people in north Malaita Island.</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Endangered Languages</h2>
<p>There are several languages that are heading for extinction. 
  These include: The Rennellese Sign Language, Oroha, Tanema, Tanibili, Riirio, Vano and Lovono.
